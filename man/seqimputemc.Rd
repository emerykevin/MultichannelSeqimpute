\arguments{
\item{list.datasets}{A list containing either a data frame containing sequences of a categorical
variable, where missing data are coded as \code{NA}, or a state sequence
object created using the \link[TraMineR]{seqdef} function. If using a
state sequence object, any "void" elements will also be treated as missing.
See the \code{end.impute} argument if you wish to skip imputing values
at the end of the sequences.}

\item{np}{Number of prior states to include in the imputation model
for internal gaps.}

\item{nf}{Number of subsequent states to include in the imputation model
for internal gaps.}

\item{m}{Number of multiple imputations to perform (default: \code{5}).}

\item{niter}{Number of iterations of the algorithm.}

\item{timing}{Logical, specifies the imputation algorithm to use.
If \code{FALSE}, the MICT algorithm is applied; if \code{TRUE}, the
MICT-timing algorithm is used.}

\item{frame.radius}{Integer, relevant only for the MICT-timing algorithm,
specifying the radius of the timeframe.}

\item{covariates}{List of the columns of the dataset
containing covariates to be included in the imputation model.}

\item{time.covariates}{List of the columns of the dataset
with time-varying covariates to include in the imputation model.}

\item{regr}{Character specifying the imputation method. Options include
\code{"multinom"} for multinomial models and \code{"rf"} for random forest
models.}

\item{npt}{Number of prior observations in the imputation model for
terminal gaps (i.e., gaps at the end of sequences).}

\item{nfi}{Number of future observations in the imputation model for
initial gaps (i.e., gaps at the beginning of sequences).}

\item{ParExec}{Logical, indicating whether to run multiple imputations
in parallel. Setting to \code{TRUE} can improve computation time depending
on available cores.}

\item{ncores}{Integer, specifying the number of cores to use for parallel
computation. If unset, defaults to the maximum number of CPU cores minus one.}

\item{SetRNGSeed}{Integer, to set the random seed for reproducibility in
parallel computations. Note that setting \code{set.seed()} alone does not
ensure reproducibility in parallel mode.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, displays progress and warnings
in the console. Use \code{FALSE} for silent computation.}

\item{available}{Logical, specifies whether to consider already imputed
data in the predictive model. If \code{TRUE}, previous imputations are
used; if \code{FALSE}, only original data are considered.}

\item{pastDistrib}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, includes the past distribution
as a predictor in the imputation model.}

\item{futureDistrib}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, includes the future
distribution as a predictor in the imputation model.}

\item{...}{Named arguments that are passed down to the imputation functions.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{seqimp}, which is a list with the following
elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{data}}{A \code{data.frame} containing the original
  (incomplete) data.}
  \item{\code{imp}}{A list of \code{m} \code{data.frame} corresponding to
  the imputed datasets.}
  \item{\code{m}}{The number of imputations.}
  \item{\code{method}}{A character vector specifying whether MICT or
  MICT-timing was used.}
  \item{\code{np}}{Number of prior states included in the imputation model.}
  \item{\code{nf}}{Number of subsequent states included in the imputation
  model.}
  \item{\code{regr}}{A character vector specifying whether multinomial or
  random forest imputation models were applied.}
  \item{\code{call}}{The call that created the object.}
}
}
\description{
This function implements the MICT-multichannel algorithms. This 
algorithm extends the MICT and MICT-timing algorithm to the case of 
multichannel sequences.
